                                        Fullstack Documentation.

                                             Introduction.

        This is the documentation of the store application project that I want to start soon. It will 
carry a limited amount of goods that can be queried and I am still contemplating on wether or not to 
their should be customers, however, I believe their should be a security login/logout.
    Here is the list of the products to be listed in the store: Books, Milk, Bread, Tomato, Papper, 
Noodles, strawberry, water, Maggie, and salt.
    
                                Technology Stack 
    The technology I will be using in the project will be as follows:
        For the backend I will be using Java springboot, mysql.
        For the frontend I will be using Reactjs
        For the version control I will be using github and maybe github actions.

                              The RESTful APIs.
