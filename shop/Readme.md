# Documentation

This is the documentation of the store application project that I want to start soon. It will
carry a limited amount of goods that can be queried.
Here is the list of the products to be listed in the store: Bread, Drink, Milk, Pepper, Rice, Strawberry

                                Technology Stack 
    The technology I will be using in the project will be as follows:
        For the backend I will be using Java springboot, mysql.
        For the version control I will be using github and maybe github actions.

                              The RESTful APIs.
